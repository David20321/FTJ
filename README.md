This repository is public for convenience and for personal use, but is not licensed for redistribution in whole or in part. We are open to issuing free permissive licenses for mods or code pieces, but you will just have to get our permission first ( contact@wolfire.com ), because we were burnt in the past by public confusion about open-source licensing. ( See http://blog.wolfire.com/2011/02/Counterfeit-Lugaru-on-Apple-s-App-Store-developing for more about this ). Thank you for understanding!
